# Promo Calendar

## Skill Card

- **Category:** Operations
- **Core problem:** How should we schedule promos to maximize conversion without operational overload?
- **Best for:** Cross-channel promo planning
- **Expected input:** Campaign goals, inventory limits, creator slots, paid budget windows
- **Expected output:** Weekly promo calendar with channel mix, owner tasks, and risk notes
- **Creatop handoff:** Use outputs in batch-content-sprint-os and deal ops execution

## Workflow

1. Define the decision question, review window, and the one KPI or business signal that matters most.
2. Normalize the evidence into a compact table so facts, assumptions, and missing fields are separated.
3. Rank the gaps or options by business impact, reversibility, and confidence.
4. Convert the diagnosis into P0 / P1 / P2 actions tied to evidence, not generic best practices.
5. End with a validation loop so the operator knows exactly how to recheck if the fix worked.
6. Separate traffic-quality issues from page / offer / catalog execution issues.

1. Collect promo constraints (inventory, budget, creator availability, events).
2. Map campaign intents to best-fit channel/time windows.
3. Detect conflicts and overload risk in execution plan.
4. Output balanced promo calendar + fallback options.

## Output Format

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Label each major claim with confidence: high / medium / low.

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Label each major claim with confidence: high / medium / low.

Return in this order:
1. Executive summary (max 5 lines)
2. Priority actions (P0/P1/P2)
3. Evidence table (signal, confidence, risk)
4. 7-day execution plan

## Quality and safety rules

- Do not schedule promo intensity beyond team capacity limits.
- Protect inventory-critical SKUs from overexposure.
- Include contingency options for creator/content delays.

## Example

**User:** Plan next week's promo calendar. We have 2 creator slots, $2K paid budget, and a new SKU launching Wednesday.

**Assistant:** Here is the optimized 7-day calendar: Monday -- teaser content on TikTok (organic); Wednesday -- new SKU launch with creator unboxing video + $800 paid push on Meta; Thursday -- second creator posts a review; Saturday -- flash deal with $1,200 remaining budget on TikTok Ads. Risk note: Back-to-back creator posts Wed/Thu may strain your content review capacity. Fallback: shift the Thursday creator post to Friday if content is not approved in time.

## Missing Data Protocol

- Ask for the smallest missing set that would change the recommendation materially.
- If the core blocker is missing (page scope, KPI baseline, or traffic context), stop short of a hard verdict and ask for it explicitly.
- If only secondary inputs are missing, continue in checklist or hypothesis mode and label every assumption.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request instead of hiding uncertainty.

- Ask for the minimum missing inputs needed to avoid misleading advice.
- If the user cannot provide them, switch to checklist or hypothesis mode and label assumptions clearly.
- Do not convert rough estimates, benchmarks, or ranges into measured facts.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request.

## Validation Loop

- Recheck: primary conversion KPI / friction signal / launch blocker count.
- Review window: after the first review window that can show a real signal.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like before closing the task.
- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

- Name the 1-3 core metrics or checkpoints to recheck after action.
- Give a review window that matches the cadence of the work.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like so the operator can close the loop.
- If the user has no analytics access, provide a manual validation checkpoint instead.

## Budget Split Model

- Default split for a simple 7-day launch: 40% launch burst / 20% mid-window learning / 40% retargeting or close.
- Add a maximum daily inventory exposure note for hero SKUs so promo success does not create fulfillment failure.
- If creator timing stretches beyond one week, extend the view to 14 days instead of forcing a cramped 7-day plan.

## When to Use

- The request is fundamentally about listing, pricing, launch, or store-ops decisions, and a decision depends on ranking evidence, diagnosing gaps, or prioritizing fixes.
- The team could take action immediately if Promo Calendar Optimizer returns a clear verdict, deliverable set, and next-step list.
- The user may describe the business problem without naming the skill; route semantically rather than by exact skill name.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not pretend a system mutation happened if the skill only has analysis or drafting context.
- Do not keep this skill active when the request clearly belongs to a narrower adjacent skill.
- Do not use this skill for writing final production assets when the core need is execution or content generation.
- Do not over-claim trend certainty from one snapshot or one anecdote.

## Required Inputs

- page / listing / store scope
- traffic or business context
- primary KPI or pain signal
- hard constraints
- baseline or benchmark expectation
- the evidence source to trust first

## Boundary and Routing

- Keep this skill focused on diagnosis and prioritization; route production copy, design, or API mutation work downstream.
- If the next step becomes commercial negotiation or execution, state the handoff point explicitly.

## Quality Rules

- Separate observed facts, user-provided facts, and assumptions.
- Do not invent exact numbers, specs, claims, certifications, or outcomes that were not provided or verified.
- Prefer the shortest useful answer shape that an operator can actually hand off.
- Do not over-generalize from one screenshot, one SKU, one creator, or one time window.
- Keep the top 3-5 actions only; backlog items belong in a secondary list.

## Success Metrics

- the operator knows the top 3-5 fixes
- the output distinguishes now / later / not yet
- one measurable KPI or gate is named for the next review
