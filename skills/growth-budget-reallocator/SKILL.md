# Growth Budget Reallocator

## Purpose

Reallocate spend across campaigns/adsets based on marginal efficiency.

## Trigger Rules

Activate for growth-stage merchants with active paid channels.

## Required Inputs

- platform and campaign scope
- time window + budget or spend context
- key performance metrics or screenshots
- known recent changes
- timeline and owner constraints
- what success should look like after the first review window

- platform and campaign scope
- time window + budget or spend context
- key performance metrics or screenshots
- known recent changes
- timeline and owner constraints
- what success should look like after the first review window

Campaign performance and inventory constraints.

## Workflow Contract

Compute marginal return -> shift budget in safe increments -> verify downstream impact.

## Deliverables

- one-line verdict or executive summary
- priority-ranked actions or next decisions
- evidence or rationale table
- risks + next-step recommendations
- sequenced plan with timing
- what to do now / later / not yet
- success metrics and switch conditions
- metric guardrails or spend thresholds

- priority-ranked actions or next decisions
- evidence or rationale table
- risks + next-step recommendations
- sequenced plan with timing
- what to do now / later / not yet
- success metrics and switch conditions
- metric guardrails or spend thresholds

Budget move log, expected vs actual impact.

## Eval Cases

- Positive: Trigger intent clearly matches this skill and required inputs are available.
- Negative: If intent is outside this skill's boundary, route to a better skill and log reason.
- Quality: Output must include evidence fields, risk status, and next action.

## Benchmark Targets

ROAS or contribution improves in >=60% reallocations.

## Improve Loop

- Record false-positive and false-negative triggers weekly.
- Update trigger wording and input requirements based on misses.
- Tighten workflow steps if verification repeatedly fails.

## Example

**User:** We're spending $50K/month across 8 Meta ad sets. ROAS ranges from 1.2x to 4.8x. How should we reallocate?

**Assistant:** After computing marginal return per ad set, I recommend shifting $8K from the bottom 3 performers (ROAS 1.2-1.8x) to the top 2 (ROAS 4.2-4.8x) in 10% daily increments. Expected blended ROAS improvement: 2.9x to 3.4x. I will monitor downstream conversion quality for 7 days to verify the impact holds.

## When to Use

- The request is fundamentally about paid media, attribution, creative, or budget efficiency, and the next step is unclear and the operator needs sequencing, thresholds, or a rollout plan.
- The team could take action immediately if Growth Budget Reallocator returns a clear verdict, deliverable set, and next-step list.
- The user may describe the business problem without naming the skill; route semantically rather than by exact skill name.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not pretend a system mutation happened if the skill only has analysis or drafting context.
- Do not keep this skill active when the request clearly belongs to a narrower adjacent skill.
- Do not use this skill when the user already has a fixed plan and only needs one asset or one mutation executed.
- Do not recommend every path at once just to avoid choosing.

- Do not recommend every path at once just to avoid choosing.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the objective, timing, and non-negotiable constraints before proposing paths.
2. Normalize the current state into a short evidence table and identify the main constraint that limits speed.
3. Choose the first path, the second path, and the explicit things to delay rather than spraying effort everywhere.
4. Turn the path choice into a short execution plan with owners, timing, and a stop / switch rule.
5. End with measurable success criteria and the earliest point to review / pivot the plan.
6. Keep traffic quality, tracking integrity, and budget efficiency separate instead of collapsing them into one verdict.

## Output Format

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Show what to do now, what to delay, and what signal should trigger a plan change.

## Boundary and Routing

- Keep this skill focused on path choice and sequencing; route narrow asset creation or system mutation work downstream.
- If the user already has a fixed plan and only needs one asset, switch to the narrower generator / execution skill.

## Quality Rules

- Separate observed facts, user-provided facts, and assumptions.
- Do not invent exact numbers, specs, claims, certifications, or outcomes that were not provided or verified.
- Prefer the shortest useful answer shape that an operator can actually hand off.
- Choose a first path; avoid giving five equal-priority options just to stay safe.
- Tie each recommendation to a review window and an operator owner.

## Missing Data Protocol

- Ask for the smallest missing set that would change the recommendation materially.
- If the core blocker is missing (spend context, metric baseline, or tracking state), stop short of a hard verdict and ask for it explicitly.
- If only secondary inputs are missing, continue in checklist or hypothesis mode and label every assumption.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request instead of hiding uncertainty.

## Validation Loop

- Recheck: CTR / CVR / CPA / ROAS or attribution integrity.
- Review window: after the first sprint / launch checkpoint.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like before closing the task.
- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

## Success Metrics

- primary efficiency metric improves without spend quality collapsing
- tracking / attribution variance narrows
- one losing action is paused or fixed within the review window

## Template Use

- Use the bundled output template when the task is recurring or handoff-heavy.
- If the real input is too weak to fill the full template honestly, keep empty sections out instead of fabricating filler.
