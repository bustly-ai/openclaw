# Refund Reason Cluster

## Skill Card

- **Category:** Post-purchase Analytics
- **Core problem:** What repeatable reasons are driving refunds and returns?
- **Best for:** Reducing avoidable refunds and preserving margins
- **Expected input:** Refund logs, return reason text, support transcripts, order metadata
- **Expected output:** Reason clusters with root-cause hypotheses and prevention actions
- **Creatop handoff:** Feed top reasons into product fixes + pre-purchase expectation copy

## Workflow

1. Define the decision question, review window, and the one KPI or business signal that matters most.
2. Normalize the evidence into a compact table so facts, assumptions, and missing fields are separated.
3. Rank the gaps or options by business impact, reversibility, and confidence.
4. Convert the diagnosis into P0 / P1 / P2 actions tied to evidence, not generic best practices.
5. End with a validation loop so the operator knows exactly how to recheck if the fix worked.
6. Separate product issue, expectation issue, policy issue, and service issue before recommending a response.

1. Normalize refund reason text and link to order/product attributes.
2. Cluster reasons by cause type (quality, fit, shipping, expectation, misuse).
3. Estimate avoidable vs unavoidable share with confidence notes.
4. Output prevention actions by short-term and long-term horizon.

## Output Format

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Label each major claim with confidence: high / medium / low.

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Label each major claim with confidence: high / medium / low.

Return in this order:
1. Executive summary (max 5 lines)
2. Priority actions (P0/P1/P2)
3. Evidence table (signal, confidence, risk)
4. 7-day execution plan

## Quality and safety rules

- Separate policy fraud/abuse from genuine product dissatisfaction.
- Highlight sample-size and data-quality caveats.
- Prioritize high-frequency + high-cost clusters first.

## Example

**User:** Here are 300 refund reason entries from last month. Cluster them and tell me what is actually fixable.

**Assistant:** Clustered into 5 groups: (1) "Doesn't fit / wrong size" -- 34%, avoidable, fix: improve size guide and add comparison photos; (2) "Not as described" -- 22%, avoidable, fix: rewrite listing copy to set accurate expectations; (3) "Arrived damaged" -- 18%, partially avoidable, fix: upgrade packaging for fragile SKUs; (4) "Changed mind" -- 15%, mostly unavoidable; (5) "Suspected fraud/abuse" -- 11%, flag for policy review. Estimated avoidable share: ~60%. Priority action: fix size guide this week (P0), rewrite top 5 listing descriptions next week (P1).

## Missing Data Protocol

- Ask for the smallest missing set that would change the recommendation materially.
- If the core blocker is missing (sample size, timeframe, or source of feedback), stop short of a hard verdict and ask for it explicitly.
- If only secondary inputs are missing, continue in checklist or hypothesis mode and label every assumption.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request instead of hiding uncertainty.

- Ask for the minimum missing inputs needed to avoid misleading advice.
- If the user cannot provide them, switch to checklist or hypothesis mode and label assumptions clearly.
- Do not convert rough estimates, benchmarks, or ranges into measured facts.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request.

## Validation Loop

- Recheck: reply quality / complaint share / refund rate / rating trend.
- Review window: after the first review window that can show a real signal.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like before closing the task.
- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

- Name the 1-3 core metrics or checkpoints to recheck after action.
- Give a review window that matches the cadence of the work.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like so the operator can close the loop.
- If the user has no analytics access, provide a manual validation checkpoint instead.

## Fraud Signal Heuristics

- Flag repeated refunds from the same address, account clusters, or unusually high-value items with weak complaint evidence.
- Separate fraud suspicion from genuine dissatisfaction in the final table.
- Never treat all high-frequency refunds as fraud without supporting pattern evidence.

## When to Use

- The request is fundamentally about reviews, refunds, retention, subscriptions, or public reply workflows, and a decision depends on ranking evidence, diagnosing gaps, or prioritizing fixes.
- The team could take action immediately if Refund Reason Cluster returns a clear verdict, deliverable set, and next-step list.
- The user may describe the business problem without naming the skill; route semantically rather than by exact skill name.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not pretend a system mutation happened if the skill only has analysis or drafting context.
- Do not keep this skill active when the request clearly belongs to a narrower adjacent skill.
- Do not use this skill for writing final production assets when the core need is execution or content generation.
- Do not over-claim trend certainty from one snapshot or one anecdote.

## Required Inputs

- feedback source
- time window + sample size
- product / SKU scope
- desired decision

## Boundary and Routing

- Keep this skill focused on diagnosis and prioritization; route production copy, design, or API mutation work downstream.
- If the next step becomes commercial negotiation or execution, state the handoff point explicitly.

## Quality Rules

- Separate observed facts, user-provided facts, and assumptions.
- Do not invent exact numbers, specs, claims, certifications, or outcomes that were not provided or verified.
- Prefer the shortest useful answer shape that an operator can actually hand off.
- Do not over-generalize from one screenshot, one SKU, one creator, or one time window.
- Keep the top 3-5 actions only; backlog items belong in a secondary list.
- Preserve useful positive signals, not only complaints or failure themes.
