# Refund Rate Reducer

## Purpose

Systematically reduce refund rate through root-cause elimination.

## Trigger Rules

Activate when refund ratio exceeds threshold.

## Required Inputs

- feedback source
- time window + sample size
- product / SKU scope
- desired decision
- timeline and owner constraints
- what success should look like after the first review window

- feedback source
- time window + sample size
- product / SKU scope
- desired decision
- timeline and owner constraints
- what success should look like after the first review window

Refund reasons, product/customer/channel segments.

## Workflow Contract

Cluster root causes -> ship targeted fixes -> re-measure cohorts.

## Deliverables

- one-line verdict or executive summary
- priority-ranked actions or next decisions
- evidence or rationale table
- risks + next-step recommendations
- sequenced plan with timing
- what to do now / later / not yet
- success metrics and switch conditions
- customer-facing or ops-facing response guidance

- risks + next-step recommendations
- sequenced plan with timing
- what to do now / later / not yet
- success metrics and switch conditions
- customer-facing or ops-facing response guidance

Refund root-cause map, fix tracker.

## Eval Cases

- Positive: Trigger intent clearly matches this skill and required inputs are available.
- Negative: If intent is outside this skill's boundary, route to a better skill and log reason.
- Quality: Output must include evidence fields, risk status, and next action.

## Benchmark Targets

Refund rate down >=15% in target cohort.

## Improve Loop

- Record false-positive and false-negative triggers weekly.
- Update trigger wording and input requirements based on misses.
- Tighten workflow steps if verification repeatedly fails.

## Example

**User:** Our refund rate jumped to 12% this month, up from 7% last month. Help me figure out why and fix it.

**Assistant:** Clustering refund reasons by product, channel, and customer segment. Top root causes: (1) Size mismatch on SKU-A204 accounts for 38% of refunds -- fix: update size chart and add fit comparison photo; (2) Shipping damage on West Coast orders at 22% -- fix: switch to reinforced packaging for that fulfillment center. Targeting these two fixes should bring refund rate back below 8% within 2 weeks. Tracking dashboard set up for daily re-measurement.

## Missing Data Protocol

- Ask for the smallest missing set that would change the recommendation materially.
- If the core blocker is missing (sample size, timeframe, or source of feedback), stop short of a hard verdict and ask for it explicitly.
- If only secondary inputs are missing, continue in checklist or hypothesis mode and label every assumption.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request instead of hiding uncertainty.

- Ask for the minimum missing inputs needed to avoid misleading advice.
- If the user cannot provide them, switch to checklist or hypothesis mode and label assumptions clearly.
- Do not convert rough estimates, benchmarks, or ranges into measured facts.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request.

## Validation Loop

- Recheck: reply quality / complaint share / refund rate / rating trend.
- Review window: after the first sprint / launch checkpoint.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like before closing the task.
- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

- Review window: after the first sprint / launch checkpoint.

- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

- Name the 1-3 core metrics or checkpoints to recheck after action.
- Give a review window that matches the cadence of the work.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like so the operator can close the loop.
- If the user has no analytics access, provide a manual validation checkpoint instead.

## Measurement Dashboard

- Recheck refund rate weekly by SKU, channel, and reason cluster.
- Track avoidable vs. unavoidable share separately.
- If no reason-code export exists, ask for at least the top 20 refund notes before recommending root causes.

## When to Use

- The request is fundamentally about reviews, refunds, retention, subscriptions, or public reply workflows, and the next step is unclear and the operator needs sequencing, thresholds, or a rollout plan.
- The team could take action immediately if Refund Rate Reducer returns a clear verdict, deliverable set, and next-step list.
- The user may describe the business problem without naming the skill; route semantically rather than by exact skill name.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not pretend a system mutation happened if the skill only has analysis or drafting context.
- Do not keep this skill active when the request clearly belongs to a narrower adjacent skill.
- Do not use this skill when the user already has a fixed plan and only needs one asset or one mutation executed.
- Do not recommend every path at once just to avoid choosing.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the objective, timing, and non-negotiable constraints before proposing paths.
2. Normalize the current state into a short evidence table and identify the main constraint that limits speed.
3. Choose the first path, the second path, and the explicit things to delay rather than spraying effort everywhere.
4. Turn the path choice into a short execution plan with owners, timing, and a stop / switch rule.
5. End with measurable success criteria and the earliest point to review / pivot the plan.
6. Separate product issue, expectation issue, policy issue, and service issue before recommending a response.

## Output Format

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Show what to do now, what to delay, and what signal should trigger a plan change.

## Boundary and Routing

- Keep this skill focused on path choice and sequencing; route narrow asset creation or system mutation work downstream.
- If the user already has a fixed plan and only needs one asset, switch to the narrower generator / execution skill.

## Quality Rules

- Separate observed facts, user-provided facts, and assumptions.
- Do not invent exact numbers, specs, claims, certifications, or outcomes that were not provided or verified.
- Prefer the shortest useful answer shape that an operator can actually hand off.
- Choose a first path; avoid giving five equal-priority options just to stay safe.
- Tie each recommendation to a review window and an operator owner.
- Preserve useful positive signals, not only complaints or failure themes.

## Success Metrics

- the targeted complaint or refund theme declines
- public-facing replies become reusable and lower confusion
- positive themes are preserved in messaging

## Template Use

- Use the bundled output template when the task is recurring or handoff-heavy.
- If the real input is too weak to fill the full template honestly, keep empty sections out instead of fabricating filler.
