# Retention Drop Checker

## Skill Card

- **Category:** Performance Diagnostics
- **Core problem:** Videos get impressions but lose viewers too early.
- **Best for:** Teams improving first-seconds retention and completion rate.
- **Expected input:** Script/transcript, retention clues, structure notes, audience.
- **Expected output:** Drop diagnosis + fix actions + next script skeleton.

## Interact First, Then Analyze

Start by confirming:
1. What do you currently have?
   - Retention curve screenshot
   - Platform-exported retention data
   - Script / transcript
   - Your own structural notes
2. What are you more interested in checking?
   - First 3-second drop
   - Mid-section drop-off
   - Pre-CTA drop-off
   - Low completion rate
3. Do you normally have your own retention segmentation logic?
4. If there is no unified logic, would you accept a recommended diagnostic framework from me first?

## Python analysis guidance

If the user provides structured retention data (CSV / export / timestamped segments):
- Generate a Python analysis script
- First explain the analysis logic
- Then output the drop map / segment diagnosis
- Finally return a reusable script

If the user does not have structured data:
- First perform a qualitative diagnosis based on script structure and visible cues
- Clearly state that this is a heuristic analysis
- Do not disguise it as a precise retention model

## Workflow

1. Define the decision question, review window, and the one KPI or business signal that matters most.
2. Normalize the evidence into a compact table so facts, assumptions, and missing fields are separated.
3. Rank the gaps or options by business impact, reversibility, and confidence.
4. Convert the diagnosis into P0 / P1 / P2 actions tied to evidence, not generic best practices.
5. End with a validation loop so the operator knows exactly how to recheck if the fix worked.
6. Separate product issue, expectation issue, policy issue, and service issue before recommending a response.

1. Clarify the available evidence and diagnosis goal.
2. Segment the video structure.
3. Identify likely drop moments.
4. Diagnose root causes.
5. Recommend practical fixes.
6. Provide next-version structure.
7. If structured data exists, return Python analysis script.

## Output Format

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Label each major claim with confidence: high / medium / low.

1. Drop diagnosis map
2. Cause list
3. Fix actions
4. Next script skeleton
5. Optional Python script (when structured data exists)

## Quality and safety rules

- Tie diagnosis to specific segments.
- Keep fixes concrete and testable.
- Preserve core product story.
- Distinguish heuristic diagnosis from data-backed diagnosis.

## Example

**User:** Our TikTok video has only 35% retention in the first 3 seconds. Here is the script opening: "Hi everyone, today I want to introduce a new product to you..." Help me diagnose this.

**Assistant:** First 3-second drop diagnosis: The opening is a typical "self-introduction opener," lacking suspense and visual impact — viewers have no reason to stay. Fix suggestions: (1) Remove "Hi everyone" and cut straight to the product use case or pain point; (2) Place a visually contrasting shot in the first second (e.g., a before/after product effect comparison); (3) Open with a question, such as "Are you still using XX?". Next version script framework: [Contrast visual 0-1s] → [Pain point question 1-2s] → [Product reveal 2-3s].

## When to Use

- The request is fundamentally about reviews, refunds, retention, subscriptions, or public reply workflows, and a decision depends on ranking evidence, diagnosing gaps, or prioritizing fixes.
- The team could take action immediately if Retention Drop Checker returns a clear verdict, deliverable set, and next-step list.
- The user may describe the business problem without naming the skill; route semantically rather than by exact skill name.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not pretend a system mutation happened if the skill only has analysis or drafting context.
- Do not keep this skill active when the request clearly belongs to a narrower adjacent skill.
- Do not use this skill for writing final production assets when the core need is execution or content generation.
- Do not over-claim trend certainty from one snapshot or one anecdote.

## Required Inputs

- feedback source
- time window + sample size
- product / SKU scope
- desired decision
- baseline or benchmark expectation
- the evidence source to trust first

## Boundary and Routing

- Keep this skill focused on diagnosis and prioritization; route production copy, design, or API mutation work downstream.
- If the next step becomes commercial negotiation or execution, state the handoff point explicitly.

## Quality Rules

- Separate observed facts, user-provided facts, and assumptions.
- Do not invent exact numbers, specs, claims, certifications, or outcomes that were not provided or verified.
- Prefer the shortest useful answer shape that an operator can actually hand off.
- Do not over-generalize from one screenshot, one SKU, one creator, or one time window.
- Keep the top 3-5 actions only; backlog items belong in a secondary list.
- Preserve useful positive signals, not only complaints or failure themes.

## Missing Data Protocol

- Ask for the smallest missing set that would change the recommendation materially.
- If the core blocker is missing (sample size, timeframe, or source of feedback), stop short of a hard verdict and ask for it explicitly.
- If only secondary inputs are missing, continue in checklist or hypothesis mode and label every assumption.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request instead of hiding uncertainty.

## Validation Loop

- Recheck: reply quality / complaint share / refund rate / rating trend.
- Review window: after the first review window that can show a real signal.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like before closing the task.
- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.
