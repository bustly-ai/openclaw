# Creator Outreach Sequence Lab

        ## Skill Card

        - **Category:** Creator Acquisition
        - **Core problem:** How to improve creator outreach reply and conversion rates?
        - **Best for:** Scaling creator outreach while keeping quality
        - **Expected input:** Creator segments, offer structure, proof assets, channel constraints
        - **Expected output:** Multi-step outreach sequence with personalization hooks and follow-up logic
        - **Creatop handoff:** Run sequence with creator-fit scorer shortlist and track responses

        ## Workflow

        1. Segment creator list by fit, size, and likely incentive sensitivity.
2. Generate step-by-step outreach sequence (first touch + follow-ups).
3. Attach proof and offer framing tuned to each segment.
4. Define stop-loss and escalation rules by response signals.

        ## Output format

        Return in this order:
        1. Executive summary (max 5 lines)
        2. Priority actions (P0/P1/P2)
        3. Evidence table (signal, confidence, risk)
        4. 7-day execution plan

        ## Quality and safety rules

        - Avoid spam-like volume without segmentation.
- Do not fabricate case studies or performance claims.
- Keep messaging compliant with platform and anti-spam rules.

## Example

**User:** I have a list of 50 micro-creators in the pet niche. How do I build an outreach sequence to recruit them as affiliates?

**Assistant:** Segment the list into 3 tiers: high-fit (pet product reviewers), medium-fit (pet lifestyle), and broad-fit (general lifestyle with pets). First touch: personalized DM referencing a specific video + affiliate offer with commission details. Follow-up 1 (day 3): value bump with a top-seller social proof stat. Follow-up 2 (day 7): polite close-the-loop. Stop rule: no reply after 3 touches = archive. 7-day execution plan and evidence table provided.

## When to Use

- The request is fundamentally about creator selection, briefing, outreach, performance, or deal operations, and a decision depends on ranking evidence, diagnosing gaps, or prioritizing fixes.
- The team could take action immediately if Creator Outreach Sequence Lab returns a clear verdict, deliverable set, and next-step list.
- The user may describe the business problem without naming the skill; route semantically rather than by exact skill name.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not pretend a system mutation happened if the skill only has analysis or drafting context.
- Do not keep this skill active when the request clearly belongs to a narrower adjacent skill.
- Do not use this skill for writing final production assets when the core need is execution or content generation.
- Do not over-claim trend certainty from one snapshot or one anecdote.

## Required Inputs

- creator handle(s) or profile links
- product / offer + target buyer
- budget or commercial constraint
- known performance or content samples
- baseline or benchmark expectation
- the evidence source to trust first

## Deliverables

- one-line verdict or executive summary
- priority-ranked actions or next decisions
- evidence or rationale table
- risks + next-step recommendations
- gap diagnosis or scorecard
- P0 / P1 / P2 action list
- confidence and evidence labels
- partner-fit or outreach / delivery guidance

- risks + next-step recommendations
- gap diagnosis or scorecard
- P0 / P1 / P2 action list
- confidence and evidence labels
- partner-fit or outreach / delivery guidance

## Workflow

1. Define the decision question, review window, and the one KPI or business signal that matters most.
2. Normalize the evidence into a compact table so facts, assumptions, and missing fields are separated.
3. Rank the gaps or options by business impact, reversibility, and confidence.
4. Convert the diagnosis into P0 / P1 / P2 actions tied to evidence, not generic best practices.
5. End with a validation loop so the operator knows exactly how to recheck if the fix worked.
6. Separate creator fit, creator operations, and creator economics rather than mixing them into one fuzzy score.

## Output Format

1. Conclusion / verdict
2. Key evidence or context table
3. Priority actions or draft output
4. Risks / caveats / missing data
5. Recommended next steps

- Label each major claim with confidence: high / medium / low.

## Boundary and Routing

- Keep this skill focused on diagnosis and prioritization; route production copy, design, or API mutation work downstream.
- If the next step becomes commercial negotiation or execution, state the handoff point explicitly.

## Quality Rules

- Separate observed facts, user-provided facts, and assumptions.
- Do not invent exact numbers, specs, claims, certifications, or outcomes that were not provided or verified.
- Prefer the shortest useful answer shape that an operator can actually hand off.
- Do not over-generalize from one screenshot, one SKU, one creator, or one time window.
- Keep the top 3-5 actions only; backlog items belong in a secondary list.
- Separate audience fit from operational fit and from commercial fit.

## Missing Data Protocol

- Ask for the smallest missing set that would change the recommendation materially.
- If the core blocker is missing (product / offer context, budget, or creator evidence), stop short of a hard verdict and ask for it explicitly.
- If only secondary inputs are missing, continue in checklist or hypothesis mode and label every assumption.
- End low-confidence outputs with the single most valuable next data request instead of hiding uncertainty.

## Validation Loop

- Recheck: reply rate / acceptance rate / content go-live / GMV proxy.
- Review window: after the first review window that can show a real signal.
- Define what improvement, no-change, and failure look like before closing the task.
- If analytics access is missing, replace the metric with a manual checkpoint and label that downgrade.

## Success Metrics

- fewer low-fit creators are approved
- reply / acceptance / go-live quality improves
- a clear upgrade / hold / stop threshold exists

## Template Use

- Use the bundled output template when the task is recurring or handoff-heavy.
- If the real input is too weak to fill the full template honestly, keep empty sections out instead of fabricating filler.
